# Project Battleship

This project focuses on practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD) by implementing the classic game "Battleship." TDD can feel challenging initially, but with consistent practice, it becomes more intuitive. The goal is to write tests first, then develop the code to pass those tests, using Jest as the testing framework.
